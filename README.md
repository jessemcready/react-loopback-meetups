#### React-Loopback Meetups
This project was created using React, Loopback, MongoDB, and MaterializeCSS. I followed TraversyMedia's React Loopback Series to create this project. The application allows users to add, view, edit, or delete meetups. Each meetup holds the meetups name, city, and address.

## React
React was used for front end development and also used ReactRouter to handle different routes.

## Loopback
Was our backend that handled CRUD requests. The loopback CLI was also used which made creating models very easy and efficient.

## MongoDB
Our database that held the meetups.  Loopback interacts really well with MongoDB so integrating Mongo was easy.

## Purpose of this project
The purpose of following the video series to create the project was to dive deeper into React and learn how to create full stack applications with React.  Loopback was a pleasant surprise in creating a backend compared to my last project, which was a MEAN stack application that used Express.JS for the backend.
